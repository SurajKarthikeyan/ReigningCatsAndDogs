## 2D Top Down Wave Based Cat Cafe Shooter - Unity

Reigning Cats and Dogs is a 2D, top down wave based combat game in which you play as an elderly cat cafe owner who must use coffee-themed weapons to defend the cafe from evil dog spirits while simulatenously serving drink to the cafe's cat customers.

The purpose of this game was to rapidy prototype. During the three weeks, the team and I worked on created a viable vertical slice for future development. 

My main tasks were the players main weapon (Gun.cs), the player movement (PlayerMovement.cs), the coffee machine (CoffeeMachine.cs), the Interactable system (IInteractable.cs) along with managing sound effets in the game (SFXManager.cs). 
The IInteractable system uses Unity Interfaces to abstract the system interaction to allow for generalized interaction that can be overloaded through interface inheritance which allows for multiple inheritance, something that isn't allowed with regular class based, OOP inheritance.
In addition to this, I worked on polishing UI elements and interactions.
